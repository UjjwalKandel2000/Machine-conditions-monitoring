# Machine-conditions-monitoring
To give a brief introduction of this project you can refer to the description below.
- `Deployment strategy` :
  - GitHub page
  - PowerPoint
  - Jupyter Notebook

### Description
This is a group project to check whether the machines working have an abnormal sound being produced and need maintenance. We need to check for anomalous sounds and the model should be able to predict if its an anomalous sound.
We have implemented classification models that we learnt in our BeCode Machine learning module.

We tried to use different models for each machine and arrive at a good machine learning model that predicts the abnormality of a machine using the sound wave given as input.

### Installation
Before running this code you need to have anaconda installed in your system and jupyter notebook running with basic libraries.

To run this code you have to clone the repository or download it as a zip file and run it. But before that we need to install some libraries to run this code.

- Create virtual environment to run this code. 
    - If you are using anaconda --> `conda create -n <yourenvname> python=x.x anaconda`
    - Activate your virtual environment -->
    `conda activate <yourenvname>`

- The library that we have used to read a sound file is `librosa`. It loads the data from a sound file and also extracts the particular features using which we can predict a model for the machines. All these libraries are written in reuirements.txt file.
To install all these libraries do the folling steps:

    1. cd to the directory where `requirements.txt` is located
    2. run the command in your shell: 
        ```javascript
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

### Repo Architecture


#### requirements.txt 

- Gives all the required libraries to run thiss code.

***
### Usage
- Once you have all the libraries successfully installed you can open and run each model to get the output
    ```javascript
    jupyter notebook
    ```

### Visuals
This is what we have acheived for one of the machines in our project.

### Timeline
Nov - Dec 2021

Time limit: 1 week --> 29/11/2021 - 3/12/2021 

This is a group project given to us at [BeCode](https://becode.org/) after completion of our study material related to Machine Learning models. I have used `pandas`, `numpy`, `librosa`, `pickle` and `scikit learn`.
The time that we took to finish this project was a week. If given more time we could improve our model and take input from the user and predict if abnormal or not.
